# Task Description

The task description initially seemed focused on the backend, but the email I received specifies that the application should be developed in React, suggesting it is intended to be a frontend application. I confirmed my understanding with the following question and received a positive response:

> **"Did I correctly understand that I should create a React app that uses a free API to display current football games and their scores, sorted as described?"**

## Next Steps

Let's proceed with developing this application! 

While we could utilize an SSE or WebSocket-based API to avoid polling, given that there appears to be no free SSE football API available at first glance, it seems sufficient for this task to use a polling-based approach.

P.S. I'm interested to try TDD it in the real project
